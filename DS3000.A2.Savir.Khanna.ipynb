Comparing to mothers who only smoked, they had babies on average babies at 6 lb and 1 oz, being definitely smaller. Mothers with hypertension reported an average of 5 lb and 9 oz, with those who both smoked and have had hypertension having babies with a mean of 5 lb and 10 oz. Please not the sample size for that last group is very samll so extrapolate their data with caution. In general, the assumptions of having either hypertension or smoking will affect the babies, with hypertension negatively impacting the child a bit more. It is worth noting that the minimum across all categories was a baby born to a smoking mother who was only 1 lb and 9 oz, an extreme outlier, perhaps suggesting smoking may have more serious ocnsequences. Again this is all relative to the dataset which only features 12 mothers with a history of hyptertension and 5 who both had a smoking and hypertension history. I would reccomend follow-up for any children below 6 lb in general, but if you have a severe history in either smoking or hypertension I would consider a check-up."
